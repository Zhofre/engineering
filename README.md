Engineering units, dimensions and quantities

The goal of this project is to create .NET standard libraries that allows unit-safe operations on measured quantities and allows consuming libraries 
to create new units based on previously defined ones. The basic libraries are designed as light-weight representation only. All serialization, simplification
and conversion functionality is added in seperate libraries to allow for modularity.
